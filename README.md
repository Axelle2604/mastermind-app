## Game rules

The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the right, providing feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A colored or black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.
